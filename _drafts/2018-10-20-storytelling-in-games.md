title: Story telling in games.

# Introduction

Before pretending to be able to understand how games could (and should?) tell stories we have to understand what makes a game well... a game.

Being an audio-visual medium, games have a lot in common with movies. Cinematography has been around for more that a century and naturally, games inherited a lot from it. This is probably the reason why there's so many cut-scenes in video games.
But games are still very different from movies.
They are *interactive*.
Interactivity is the core of games, the game displays something and the player acts based on what he sees.
This is true for every game that has ever been created. The question is, how can we use interactivity carry our stories?

I certainly won't provide a definitive answer in this blog post but I hope this can start a healthy conversation on the topic.

# How games currently tell stories.

Very few games take profit from this interactivity to enhance their storytelling. Cut-scenes, which have proven to be very effective and are used in pretty much every game that tries to tell a story. While they are definitely a tool that designers can use, in my opinion over using cut-scenes is either a lack of understanding of the medium or laziness. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying games that use cut-scenes are bad, The Last Of Us is amazing and features one of the most engaging story I've played through.

As I said before, games are interactive and designers should take advantage of this.
Some game developpers are trying to play around with interactivity more or less successfully. 

The first ones that come to my mind is Quantic Dream, and Telltale games come in mind. But while I like their intention of letting the player influence the direction of the story, I think the execution is flawed.
There's a few reasons for that:

* Three or four choices in one situation can't always predict what the player would have liked to do.
* Choices are often vaguely described and the character ends up something different than expected.
* QTEs over a cut-scene is in most cases boring. The player is barely in control of his avatar.

Some other games like Half Life let the player in control of the avatar at all times and this is a step in the right direction. however, half life still has the same problem that most games have: Its gameplay and story never work together to make for a better experience. It's always a gameplay sequence followed by a story moment (whether it's a cinematic or people next to you talking about the plot)

One of my favorite games is Firewatch and while its gameplay stays relatively simple, It's probably the game I've felt the most immersed into and this for a few reasons:

* The intro lets you know who you are embodying in the first five minutes of the game. The connection between you and your avatar is strong because _you_ made the decisions that brought him where he is today.
* While the story is fairly linear the options you are given during the dialogs are sensible and made a lot of sense in the context of the conversation.
* The dialogs are very well written is and voice acting is on point.
* The characters (you included) evolve in a very natural and believable way.

I haven't played them but I hear Fumito Ueda's games make interesting attempts in pushing their story with their gameplay. I suggest you watch [this video talking about The Last Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qot5_rMB8Jc).
