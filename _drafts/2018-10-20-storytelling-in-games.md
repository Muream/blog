# Introduction

<!--Last year, I started writing a few articles named The Last Of Us - No Cut-scene edition. My goal there was to try and re-imagine The Last Of Us' intro without cut-scenes while I'm still interested in this kind of exercise, I started doing it without clear guidelines and it felt like I didn't quite know what I was doing. This article aims to provide those guidelines and explain why they are important.

Before pretending to be able to understand how games could (and should?) tell stories we have to understand what makes a game well... a game.

Being an audio-visual medium, games have a lot in common with movies. Cinematography has been around for more that a hundred years and naturally, games inherited a lot from it. This is probably the reason why there's so many cut-scenes in video games. 
But games are still very different from movies.  
They are *interactive*.  
Interactivity is the core of games, the game displays something and the player acts based on what he sees.

# How games currently tell stories.
The thing is, very few games take profit from this interactivity to enhance their storytelling. Cut-scenes which have proven to be very effective and are used in pretty much every game that tries to tell a story. While Cut-scenes are definitely a tool that designers can use, over using it is in my opinion lazy. As I said before, games are interactive and designers should take advantage of this.  
Some studios are trying to play around with interactivity more or less successfully. Quantic Dream and Telltale games come in mind but while I like their intention, I think their execution is flawed.  
There's a few reasons for that:
* Three or four choices in one situation can't always predict what the player would have liked to do.
* Choices are often vaguely described and the character ends up something different than expected.
* QTEs over a cut-scene is in most cases boring. The player is barely in control of his avatar.

# How we can use interactivity to tell stories.
As I said, I like Quantic Dream's intentions and that's because they take the player action into account. Not just his choices but his mistakes and failures as well. This is key to immerse the player in the story you're telling him, That makes him an actor instead of a spectator.
